                    Charles Rolls and Henry Royce founded Rolls-Royce Ltd in 1906. <br>United by a historic meeting at the Midland Hotel Manchester by Henry Edmunds who had a car showroom in London and a friend of Charles Rolls.
                    <br>The pairing of the engineering brilliance of Royce with the equally brilliant business acumen and financial backing of Rolls was to become legendary. <br>Even today the name <q>Rolls-Royce</q> has become a byword for excellence.

                    Charles Rolls was born on 27 <sup>th</sup> August 1877, the third son of Lord and Lady Llangattock. <br>Though his registered birthplace was at 35 Hill Street, off Berkeley Square in London, his heart was always at the family's ancestral
                    home, The Hendre, in Monmouthshire, on the border of Wales and England. <br>His aptitude and enthusiasm for engineering were evident from childhood. <br> When he was nine, he rigged up an electric bell between his bedroom and the stables
                    at The Hendre. <br> A few years later, he also planned and supervised the installation of electricity in the main house; in an early demonstration of the powers of persuasion that would later make him world-famous, he induced his father
                    to pay for it.

                    funded by one of his aunts. <br>Despite not having a formal education, Royce grasped every opportunity to educate himself, studying algebra, French and electrical engineering in his free time. <br>With a natural talent for engineering,
                    Royce moved to Liverpool in 1882 landing a job with the Electric Light and Power Company working on theatre and street lighting.

                    There once was a time when love for cars came without a gush of guilt-stream shooting right through our hearts. Well, it was a long time ago and there was nothing to look back to in fear and anger. The beginning of the 20th century was simply yet another
                    opportunity for the assayers of development and Scouters of luxury; it was time to add a little sophistication to inventions, creating brands out of products, however similar in functions they may be. We know, not much has changed.

                    As the automobiles grew in popularity slowly carving their way towards becoming a necessity, in 1904, two men met for lunch at Manchester. C.S Rolls, then 26, came from a very elite family with a deep-seated fascination with machinery and racing, along
                    with ballooning. A mechanical engineer from Cambridge, Rolls had the most powerful car at the time, the 3.75 horsepower Peugeot.

                <p>
                    After setting up a company, with Claude Johnson, to import and sell foreign cars, Rolls wanted to actualize his dream to have an English car bearing his name. Came with a wish-filling wand at lunch Henry Royce, 40 at the time, from a Cambridge farming
                    family who started selling papers from the age of 9 and got himself enrolled into a night school. He started an electrical engineering business in Manchester and got into designing and building his own cars, characterized by their
                    speed and reliability.

                    A mutual friend and autocarist, Henry Edmunds, dragged Charles Rolls to meet Henry Royce. Rolls was so awestruck by Royce, both the person and his quiet and cylindrical car. Rolls borrowed it, drove it back to London, woke Claude Johnson up in the middle
                    of the night and coaxed him into riding it with him then and there. The first Rolls Royce appeared in 1904 with its symbolically teethed radiator all set to cut the wind with its motor roar. Johnson, the managing director, Royce the
                    designer, and Rolls the marketer, in 1906, produced the first Rolls Royce bannered watershed luxury car called the Silver Ghost. It rode so smoothly that a glass of water stood on the engine without spilling. This defied everything
                    the motor world thitherto knew of and became the best-selling car.
